Dynamic Vaccine Allocation Model

This model allocates a limited daily supply of vaccines, where the allocations are coupled with dynamics of disease transmissions. It was used in a recent XX paper.

For a placeholder dummy dataset and an example simulation run, please see "run_ approx._opt.py", which uses a dummy intermediate dataset "test input approxmation.csv"
