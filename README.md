# DVaxMod
Dynamic Vaccine Allocation Model

This model allocates a limited daily supply of vaccines, where the allocations are coupled with dynamics of disease transmissions. It was used in a recent XX paper.

For a placeholder dummy dataset and an example run of the optimal allocation, please see "run_ approx._opt.py", which uses a dummy intermediate dataset "test input opt approxmation.csv". For a placeholder dummy dataset and an example run of the uniform allocation, please see "run_unif.R", which uses a dummy parameter dataset "test input parameter.csv".
